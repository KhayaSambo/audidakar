          This website was designed by me using react and typescript and is not
          only responsive, but it also supports dark and light mode (go ahead
          and try it out!). I also made use of Audi's Media Center images and
          typography to make things cohesive. I also took extra care to read
          through their guidelines.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.5em" }}>
          Front end engineering is my passion and I always strive to learn more.
          When the recruiter told me that I would be working with Audi, I was
          thrilled and challenged to create something that would demonstrate my
          skills and creativity. And guess what? I managed to get this website
          up and running in just 2 days!{" "}
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.5em" }}>
